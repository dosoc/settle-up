React App

Project is an app to settle golf bets.

Goals:
1. Take in Players and add them to a scorecard
2. Add Hole-by-hole scores to scorecard
3. take in different bet types and wager amounts (matchplay, stroke, nassau, skins, etc..)
4. calculate bets as hole by hole scores are entered
5. automatically settle all bets and provide a "bet sheet" 

eventual product will require a database and user login to save player information and bet history.
